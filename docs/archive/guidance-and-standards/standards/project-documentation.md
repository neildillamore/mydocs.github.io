# Project Documentation

## Introduction
There are minimal standards that should be achieved across all projects for the documenation
produced. This ranges from architectural diagrams and design documentation to documentation 
within code etc.

This page describes the sort of documentation and documentation structure that should be
achieved for all projects. It also attempts to give examples of good documentation that can 
be used as a template or a benchmark.

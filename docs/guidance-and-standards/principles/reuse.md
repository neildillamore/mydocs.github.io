# Principle of Reuse

## Introduction
Reuse as a concept is simple to achieve. In practice it can be more difficult.
In general, we should encourage reuse wherever possible, this can be within a project
but also can span wider to cross project.

There are things that can be done to bootstrap projects to make everyones lives simpler
and reuse can make it easier to transition from one project to another

Reuse can extend across many areas of a project, some examples:

* Documentation
* Project Initiation
* Project Cadence
* Template Code Libraries
* Code Snippets
* etc
